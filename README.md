# multi LLM debate
## üåè Overview
Are you like me? Do you also have an unquenchable desire to watch people fight? LLMs are too helpful these days, we need to make them more toxic. That's why I built `multi LLM debate`. Currently, it is running strictly on CLI, but maybe one day I will make it better. Maybe not.

Basically, our debate consists of 3 stages:
1. **Initialization**. Each LLM are given the opportunity to make their point without being affected by other LLMs. (One Round).
2. **Debate**. At each LLM turn, it will use RAG to retrieve relevant previous discussion points, then respond to it. (You can specify how many rounds this will go for).
3. **Verdict**. Each LLM can make their closing comments and a judge LLM will determine which one is the best answer. (One Round).
